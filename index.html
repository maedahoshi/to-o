    <h2>Cultural Heritage of Ecuador</h2>
    <p>The churches of Quito emerged after the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, when religion played a central role in the organization of the new colonial society. Spanish missionaries, especially religious orders such as the Franciscans and Jesuits, built churches as places of worship and as centers for teaching Christianity to the indigenous population. Over time, these buildings were constructed using local materials and indigenous labor, which led to a unique architectural style that combined European religious designs with native artistic elements. As a result, the churches became not only religious spaces but also important cultural and historical symbols of the city.</p>

One of its most distinctive features is its gargoyles shaped like animals from Ecuador. The basilica also offers impressive views of the city, making it both a religious site and a popular tourist attraction.s</p>
